# sign-up-form
This project was part of The Odin Project, so tried to keep this viking themed.
Liked this one because css is easy and fast to learn, well maybe it is because i have read it all before?. Well anyways it was nice to flex css and html muscles since it has been awhile.

Also nice to know i can reuse this code later and i still got it..
